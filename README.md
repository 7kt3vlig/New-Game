This is my first game using the pygame module in python 


HOW TO RUN IN VSCODE 

1. Download VSCODE at https://code.visualstudio.com/ and select your OS
2. Open a terminal, powershell or commandprompt for windows, bash for macOS and Linux
3. Pip install pygame with the command "pip install pygame" or "pip3 install pygame"
4. In VSCODE also install "Code Runner" to make it easier to run the game. Code Runner can be found under the extensions section on the left hand side of VSCODE.
